_Range helps teams know what’s happening, stay in sync, and actually feel like a team. It’s
thoughtfully designed software that helps teams share daily check-ins, track goals, and run better
meetings. So you can do your best work together._

_Everything is easier in Range because it works with the tools you already use. Your tasks,
documents, and code changes are already in Range, so you don’t have to enter data twice._

### Extending Range for Chrome

We want to support commonly used workplace tools, and will respond to customer and community demand
accordingly. If you would like to see support for a service, please file an issue. We also
welcome [contributions](./contributing.md).

The Chrome Extension works well for services where you are actively working on an artifact; say
editing a document, writing an article, completing a checklist.

It doesn't work well for services where there are passive actions or actions carried out by other
users, for example project management tools or CRMs. To support these types of tools, the Range Team
will continue to add first-party OAuth based integrations when possible. You can also implement your
own integrations via our
[incoming suggestions API](https://help.range.co/integrations/custom-range-integrations)
using webhooks.
